# particleFilterEstimation

This is an implementation of the Particle Filter algorithm from https://github.com/johnhw/pfilter to estimate parameters of a model. This algorithm was slightly modified in order to obtain the closest result with the MATLAB version of Particle Filter https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ref/stateestimatorpf.html
